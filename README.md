# B.E.R.T. (Beet Electronic Remote watering Technology)

This is the documentation of my little project, which should help to reduce the amount of water needed to keep a beet alive. It also makes maintenance much easier.

## Versions
Due to some differences in the development approach, we have decided on a versioning of this project:
[1.0](/1.0/Readme.md) with a Raspberry Pi Pico, in C, did not get past the testing stage.
[2.0](/2.0/Readme.md) with an Arduino Uno, works without sensors, with RTC once a day
