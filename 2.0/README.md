# Version 2.0 
since version 1 was with the Raspberry pi pico board and this version is for an Arduino Uno we decided to version those two code variants.

## code
- the `calculation_of_runtime` code is for calculating how long one pump has to run for it to move a certain amount of mililiters. It qworks with the press of a button, wired from grownd to the specified pin
- the `watering_plants` code ist for executing a plant watering process which approximtely moves 200 ml of water. It also contains a RTC integration which sets itself automatically to the compile time. the pumps are run with an extra power source connected via Transistors. 

**The Documentation will be limited since this is just planned to be a solution for limited time**
